    "# The Optimal Allocation Strategy Between Tax Advantaged and Tax Deferred Funds\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the United States tax code, wage earners have the option to set aside money in either tax deferred or tax advantaged accounts for retirement. A common question is what is the optimal strategy to allocate such funds. The purpose of this paper to model various scenarios to find the opitmal allocation strategies\n",
